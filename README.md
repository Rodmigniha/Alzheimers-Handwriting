# Alzheimer’s Disease Detection Through Handwriting Analysis ✍️🧠

This repository contains my work for the Kaggle competition **[Alzheimer’s Disease Detection Through Handwriting Analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/m-2-bdia-dl-project-2024)**. The goal is to develop a predictive model that can accurately differentiate between Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients and healthy individuals based on handwriting data.

---

## 📋 Competition Overview

The **DARWIN dataset** is specifically designed for early detection of Alzheimer’s disease through handwriting analysis. The dataset contains data from **174 participants**, with handwriting features extracted from **25 tasks** (450 features total).

### Dataset Details
- **Training Data**: 62 AD patients and 62 healthy individuals.
- **Test Data**: Includes 70 samples (public and private test sets).
- **File Structure**:
  - `data.csv`: Training data with 450 features and class labels (`1` for AD, `0` for Healthy).
  - `test.csv`: Test data with 450 features (without class labels).
  - `sample_submission.csv`: Example submission format.
  - `class_indexes.csv`: Information mapping class labels.

### Prediction Task
The task is to predict the class label (`1` for AD patient, `0` for healthy) for each participant in the test set based on their handwriting features.

## 🚀 Approach

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- **Feature Scaling**: The dataset contains a significant imbalance in the values of the variables, which was addressed through data normalization.
- **Target Variable Distribution**: The target variable (`class`) is imbalanced, with **62% of participants being patients** and **38% healthy**.
- **Feature Engineering**: Calculated statistical summaries (e.g., min, max, mean, variance, median) for each of the 18 features per task.

### 2. Model Development
- **Model**: Developed a **Neural Network** with two hidden layers using TensorFlow/Keras.
  - **Architecture**: 90 neurons in the first layer, 36 neurons in the second, and a sigmoid output layer for binary classification.
- **Loss Function**: Binary Cross-Entropy for a binary classification task.
- **Optimizer**: Adam Optimizer.

### 3. Model Evaluation
- Trained the model for **20 epochs** with batch size of **9**.
- Evaluated the model using **accuracy** and **AUC-ROC**.
- Plotted learning curves (accuracy and loss) for both training and validation data.
- Generated **confusion matrix** and calculated **accuracy** and **AUC ROC**.

### 4. Submission
- After training and evaluation, made predictions on the **test dataset**, generated the final submission file, and downloaded the results.

## 📊 Results

### Key Findings:
- **Accuracy**: Achieved a final test accuracy of **[insert final accuracy here]%**.
- **AUC ROC**: [Insert AUC ROC score here].
- **Confusion Matrix**: The confusion matrix reveals the model's performance in classifying true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.

### Visualizations:
- **Learning Curves**: Plots showing the training and validation accuracy/loss.
- **Confusion Matrix**: Shows the distribution of predicted labels versus true labels.
- **ROC Curve**: Displays the model’s true positive rate against its false positive rate.

### Steps to follow:
1. **Add this `README.md` file to your local repository.**
2. **Create a `requirements.txt` file** to list the necessary libraries, e.g.:
   ```plaintext
   pandas
   numpy
   seaborn
   matplotlib
   torch
   tensorflow
   scikit-learn
   ```
3. **Add a `.gitignore` file** to avoid pushing unnecessary files:
   ```plaintext
   __pycache__/
   .ipynb_checkpoints/
   data/
   results/
   *.csv
   *.log
   ```
4. **Push your project to GitHub**.
